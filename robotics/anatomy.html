      <h1 class="title">Anatomy of Robotic Manipulator</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A robotic manipulator is a device that can perform various tasks by
          manipulating objects in its environment. A robotic manipulator
          consists of several components that work together to achieve the
          desired motion and functionality. Here, we will explore the anatomy of
          a robotic manipulator and explain the role of each component.
        </p>
        <p>The main components of a robotic manipulator are:</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>
          These are the rigid elements that connect the joints and form the
          structure of the manipulator. Links can have different shapes and
          sizes, depending on the design and application of the robot. Links can
          also carry actuators, sensors, wires, and other devices that are
          needed for the operation of the robot.
        </p>
        <h2>Joints</h2>
        <p>
          These are the movable connections between the links that allow
          relative motion between them. Joints can be classified into two types:
          revolute and prismatic. Revolute joints allow rotational motion around
          an axis, while prismatic joints allow linear motion along an axis.
          Joints can have different degrees of freedom (DOF), which is the
          number of independent directions in which they can move. The total DOF
          of a manipulator is the sum of the DOF of all its joints.
        </p>
        <h2>End Effectors</h2>
        <p>
          An end effector is a device or tool that is attached to the end of a
          robotic arm. It is designed to interact with the environment and
          perform a specific task, such as grasping, welding, painting, or
          cutting. The end effector can be changed depending on the application
          and the desired outcome. End effectors are also known as robot hands,
          grippers, or manipulators.
        </p>
        <h2>Actuators</h2>
        <p>
          These are the devices that provide the power and force to move the
          joints and links. Actuators can be electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, or
          other types, depending on the requirements and specifications of the
          robot. Actuators can be mounted on the links or inside them, depending
          on the design and space constraints of the robot.
        </p>
        <h2>Sensors</h2>
        <p>
          These are the devices that measure and provide feedback on various
          aspects of the robot's state and environment. Sensors can measure
          position, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, temperature,
          pressure, light, sound, and other physical quantities. Sensors can be
          mounted on the links, joints, actuators, or other parts of the robot.
          Sensors can be used for control, monitoring, safety, or other
          purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Controller</h2>
        <p>
          This is the device that processes the sensor data and generates
          commands for the actuators to achieve the desired motion and
          functionality of the robot. The controller can be a computer, a
          microcontroller, a programmable logic controller (PLC), or other types
          of devices. The controller can implement various algorithms and
          methods to control the robot, such as kinematics, dynamics, trajectory
          planning, feedback control, feedforward control, adaptive control,
          learning control, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the main components that make up a robotic manipulator. By
          understanding their anatomy and function, we can better design, build,
          operate, and maintain robotic manipulators for various applications
          and domains.
