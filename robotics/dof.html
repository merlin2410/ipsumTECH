      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Degrees of freedom represent the number of independent motions or
          parameters that define the position and orientation of an object in
          space. In robotics, DOF indicate the number of independent variables
          needed to specify the state of a robot.
        </p>
        <h2>Degrees of Freedom of a Point in 2D Space</h2>
        <p>
          In 2D space, a point has two degrees of freedom: one for its
          x-coordinate and another for its y-coordinate. These two parameters
          are independent and define the location of the point.
        </p>
        <h2>Degrees of Freedom of a Point in 3D Space</h2>
        <p>
          In 3D space, a point has three degrees of freedom: one for each of its
          x, y, and z coordinates. These three parameters are independent and
          define the location of the point in three-dimensional space.
        </p>
        <h2>Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body in 2D Space</h2>
        <p>
          In 2D space, a rigid body (an object that does not deform or change
          shape) has three degrees of freedom: two for its position (x and y)
          and one for its orientation (usually represented as an angle, such as
          the rotation about the z-axis).
        </p>
        <h2>Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body in 3D Space</h2>
        <p>
          In 3D space, a rigid body has six degrees of freedom: three for its
          position (x, y, and z coordinates) and three for its orientation
          (roll, pitch, and yaw angles). These six parameters are needed to
          describe the location and orientation of the rigid body in
          three-dimensional space.
        </p>
        <h2>Degrees of Freedom for a Robotic Manipulator</h2>
        <p>
          A robotic manipulator is a complex system composed of multiple rigid
          bodies (links) connected by joints. The degrees of freedom of a
          robotic manipulator represent the total number of independent ways the
          manipulator can move and position its end-effector (the tool or hand
          of the robot) in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The degrees of freedom of a robotic manipulator depend on its
          kinematic structure. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>
                A simple planar manipulator with two revolute joints has 2 DOF, allowing it to move in a plane.
            </li>
            <li>
                A 6-DOF robotic arm can move freely in three-dimensional space, with 6 independent joint motions.
            </li>
            <li>
                More complex robotic systems with additional joints or features may have higher DOF to perform tasks like grasping, reaching, and manipulating objects in a more versatile manner.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In summary, degrees of freedom in robotics refer 
          to the number of independent parameters required to describe the position and orientation of a robotic system. Understanding the DOF of a robotic manipulator is essential for tasks such as control, trajectory planning, and ensuring that the robot can perform specific tasks effectively and efficiently.</p>
