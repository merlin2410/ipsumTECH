        <p>
          Automation and robotics are two related concepts in the field of
          technology and manufacturing, but they have distinct differences in
          terms of their applications and characteristics. Here's an explanation
          of each term and their differences:
        </p>
        <h2>Automation</h2>
        <p>
          Automation refers to the process of using technology, machinery, or
          computer software to perform tasks and processes with minimal human
          intervention. The primary goal of automation is to increase
          efficiency, reduce human error, improve productivity, and lower labour
          costs. Automation can be applied to various industries and tasks,
          including manufacturing, agriculture, logistics, and information
          technology. Key characteristics of automation include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Repetitive Tasks: Automation is well-suited for tasks that are
            repetitive and require consistency. Machines or software can perform
            these tasks without getting tired or making mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited Decision-Making: Automation systems typically follow
            pre-programmed instructions or algorithms and have limited
            decision-making capabilities. They can handle well-defined tasks but
            may struggle with complex or unpredictable situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost Savings: Automation often leads to cost savings by reducing the
            need for human labour and increasing production efficiency. However,
            there are initial setup costs associated with implementing
            automation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples: Conveyor belt systems in factories, email autoresponders,
            and home thermostat systems are all examples of automation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <p>
          Robotics involves the design, construction, programming, and operation
          of machines or robots that are capable of performing tasks
          autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robots are physical devices that
          can move, interact with their environment, and often have sensors and
          the ability to make decisions based on the data they collect. Robotics
          encompasses a wide range of applications, from manufacturing and
          healthcare to space exploration and entertainment. Key characteristics
          of robotics include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Physical Interaction: Robots are physical entities that can interact
            with objects in the real world. They have sensors and actuators that
            enable them to perform tasks like picking up objects, welding, or
            even performing surgery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Versatility: Robots can be versatile and adaptable, capable of
            performing a variety of tasks when properly programmed. This makes
            them suitable for tasks that require flexibility and agility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decision-Making: Depending on their complexity, robots can have
            varying levels of decision-making capabilities. Advanced robots may
            use artificial intelligence and machine learning to make decisions
            in real-time based on their environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost Variation: The cost of developing and implementing robotics can
            vary significantly, from simple, cost-effective robots to highly
            sophisticated and expensive ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples: Industrial robots used in car manufacturing, surgical
            robots for medical procedures, and drones used for various
            applications are examples of robotics.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In summary, automation is a broader concept that involves the use of
          technology to streamline processes and reduce human involvement in
          tasks. Robotics, on the other hand, is a subset of automation that
          specifically deals with the development and use of physical machines
          or robots capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous actions. While both
          automation and robotics aim to improve efficiency and productivity,
          robotics involves the creation of intelligent, physical entities that
          can interact with their surroundings in more complex ways.
