          Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that draws knowledge and
          techniques from a wide range of disciplines to design, build, and
          operate robots. This interdisciplinary nature is essential because
          robots are complex systems that require expertise from various domains
          to function effectively. Here are some of the key disciplines that
          contribute to the interdisciplinary nature of robotics:
