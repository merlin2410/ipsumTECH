          The field of robotics is continually evolving, with an ever-expanding
          array of robots designed to perform a wide range of tasks. These
          robots are divided into several categories based on their mobility and
          functionality. In this article, we will delve into three prominent
          categories of robots: Manipulators, Mobile Robots (including Wheeled
          and Legged variants), and Aerial Robots.
        </p>
        <h2>Manipulators</h2>
        <div class="manipulator-img">

        </div>
        <p>
          Manipulator robots, often referred to as robotic arms, are versatile
          machines designed for precision and controlled movement. These robots
          are typically used in industrial applications, research laboratories,
          and even in space exploration. Key characteristics of manipulators
          include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Articulated Arms:</strong> These robotic arms consist of
            multiple joints and can mimic the movements of a human arm. They are
            widely used in tasks such as welding, assembly, and material
            handling in manufacturing industries.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delta Robots:</strong> Known for their incredible speed and
            accuracy, delta robots are commonly used in industries like food
            packaging, electronics assembly, and pick-and-place applications.

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SCARA Robots:</strong> Selective Compliance Articulated
            Robot Arms (SCARA) are ideal for applications requiring fast and
            precise horizontal movement, such as precision assembly and 3D
            printing.

        <p>
          Mobile robots are designed to move autonomously or semi-autonomously.
          They are used in various domains, including logistics, agriculture,
          and search and rescue operations. There are two primary subcategories
          of mobile robots: Wheeled and Legged.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Wheeled Robots:</strong> Wheeled robots are equipped with
            wheels for locomotion and are commonly used in environments with
            flat and smooth surfaces. They are efficient for tasks like
            warehouse automation, surveillance, and delivery services. Examples
            include autonomous floor-cleaning robots and self-driving cars.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legged Robots:</strong> Legged robots use legs for movement,
            allowing them to navigate uneven and challenging terrains. These
            robots are often employed in search and rescue missions, exploration
            of rough terrains, and military applications. Examples include
            Boston Dynamics' quadruped robots like Spot and bipedal robots like
            Atlas.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Aerial robots, also known as drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
          (UAVs), are designed for tasks that require aerial mobility. They have
          found applications in industries ranging from agriculture to
          cinematography and military operations. Key features of aerial robots
          include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed-Wing Drones:</strong> These drones have fixed wings
            like traditional airplanes and are excellent for long-range
            missions, such as aerial mapping, surveillance, and cargo delivery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multirotor Drones:</strong> Multirotor drones, equipped with
            multiple rotors, offer excellent maneuverability and stability. They
            are commonly used for tasks like aerial photography, surveying, and
            recreational flying.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hybrid Drones:</strong> Some drones combine features of both
            fixed-wing and multirotor drones, providing versatility in various
            applications.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The world of robotics is incredibly diverse, with robots designed to
          tackle a wide range of tasks and challenges. Understanding the
          different categories of robots, including manipulators, mobile robots
          (wheeled and legged), and aerial robots, is essential to appreciate
          their unique capabilities and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology advances, we can expect these categories to expand
          further and overlap in some cases, creating innovative hybrid robots
          that can operate in various environments. Whether they are assisting
          in manufacturing, exploring hazardous terrains, or capturing
          breathtaking aerial views, robots continue to play an increasingly
          important role in our lives, offering solutions to some of the most
          complex problems we face today.
