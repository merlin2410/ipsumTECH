      <h1 class="title">Links of Robotic Manipulator</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A robotic manipulator is a device that can perform various tasks by
          manipulating objects in its environment. A robotic manipulator
          consists of several rigid links connected by joints, which can be
          either fixed or movable. The links of a robotic manipulator are
          usually arranged in a serial or parallel configuration, depending on
          the desired degrees of freedom and workspace.

        <p>
          The links of a robotic manipulator are often modelled as vectors,
          which represent their position and orientation in a coordinate system.
          The vectors can be expressed in terms of joint variables, which are
          the angles or displacements of the joints. The relationship between
          the joint variables and the link vectors is called the kinematics of
          the robotic manipulator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kinematics of a robotic manipulator can be divided into two types:
          forward and inverse. Forward kinematics is the problem of finding the
          link vectors given the joint variables, while inverse kinematics is
          the problem of finding the joint variables given the link vectors.
          Forward kinematics is usually easier to solve than inverse kinematics,
          since there is a unique solution for each set of joint variables.
          However, inverse kinematics may have multiple or no solutions for a
          given set of link vectors, depending on the geometry and constraints
          of the robotic manipulator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The links of a robotic manipulator are also subject to forces and
          torques, which affect their motion and stability. The forces and
          torques can be caused by gravity, friction, inertia, external loads,
          or actuation. The relationship between the forces and torques and the
          joint variables is called the dynamics of the robotic manipulator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dynamics of a robotic manipulator can be described by a set of
          differential equations, which relate the joint variables, their
          derivatives, and their second derivatives to the forces and torques.
          The differential equations can be derived using various methods, such
          as Lagrange's equations, Newton-Euler equations, or Kane's equations.
          The differential equations can be used to simulate the motion of the
          robotic manipulator, or to design controllers that can regulate its
          behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The links of a robotic manipulator are essential components that
          determine its performance and functionality. By understanding the
          kinematics and dynamics of the links, one can design and control
          robotic manipulators for various applications, such as industrial
          automation, medical surgery, space exploration, or entertainment.
