      <h1 class="title">Hard Automation vs Soft Automation</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Hard automation and soft automation are two different approaches to
          automation in manufacturing and other industries. They differ in their
          degree of flexibility, complexity, and adaptability to changing tasks
          and conditions. Here's a breakdown of each:
        </p>
        <h2>Hard Automation:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Hard automation refers to the use of fixed or rigid automation
            systems to perform specific tasks or processes with little to no
            variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is typically employed for high-volume, repetitive tasks that
            require a high degree of precision and consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hard automation systems are designed and set up to perform a
            specific task or a narrow range of tasks efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once hard automation is implemented, it is often challenging and
            expensive to reconfigure or adapt for new tasks or products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples of hard automation include conveyor belt systems, robotic
            arms dedicated to a single task, and assembly line machinery.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Soft Automation:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Soft automation, also known as flexible automation, is designed to
            be more adaptable and versatile than hard automation.
          </li>
          <li>
            It involves the use of automation technologies that can be easily
            reprogrammed or reconfigured to perform different tasks or handle
            variations in product design.
          </li>
          <li>
            Soft automation is suitable for environments where tasks may change
            frequently, production volumes are moderate, or customization is
            required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programmable logic controllers (PLCs), industrial robots with
            advanced programming capabilities, and computer numerical control
            (CNC) machines with user-friendly software interfaces are examples
            of soft automation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Soft automation allows for faster changeovers and adjustments to
            accommodate different products or production requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Key Differences</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Flexibility: Hard automation is inflexible and optimized for
            specific tasks, while soft automation is adaptable and can handle
            multiple tasks or product variations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complexity: Soft automation systems tend to be more complex in terms
            of programming and control because they must handle a wider range of
            tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost: Hard automation can be cost-effective for high-volume,
            long-term production, while soft automation may have a higher
            initial setup cost but can provide cost savings in terms of
            versatility and adaptability over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changeability: Hard automation is challenging to change once set up,
            whereas soft automation can be reprogrammed or reconfigured
            relatively easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suitable Applications: Hard automation is best suited for mass
            production scenarios with consistent tasks, while soft automation is
            better for smaller production runs, customizations, or industries
            with rapidly changing product requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In practice, many manufacturing environments use a combination of hard
          and soft automation to strike a balance between efficiency and
          adaptability based on their specific needs and production goals.
