      <h1 class="title">Joints of a Robotic Manipulator</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A robotic manipulator is a device that can move objects in a
          controlled manner using one or more links and joints. The links are
          rigid bodies that connect the joints, and the joints are the points of
          rotation or translation that allow the links to move relative to each
          other. The joints of a robotic manipulator can be classified into two
          types: revolute and prismatic.
        </p>
        <h2>Revolute Joint</h2>

        <p>
          A revolute joint is a joint that allows a link to rotate around an
          axis. A revolute joint has one degree of freedom (DOF), which is the
          angle of rotation. A revolute joint can be modelled as a hinge or a
          pin joint. A common example of a revolute joint is the elbow joint in
          the human arm.
        </p>
        <h2>Prismatic Joint</h2>
        <div>

        </div>
        <p>
          A prismatic joint is a joint that allows a link to slide along an
          axis. A prismatic joint has one degree of freedom, which is the
          distance of translation. A prismatic joint can be modelled as a slider
          or a piston. A common example of a prismatic joint is the telescopic
          arm in a crane.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The number and type of joints in a robotic manipulator determine its
          configuration and capabilities. A robotic manipulator can have
          different kinematic structures, such as serial, parallel, or hybrid. A
          serial manipulator is a manipulator that has only one chain of links
          and joints, such as a robotic arm. A parallel manipulator is a
          manipulator that has multiple chains of links and joints that connect
          the base and the end-effector, such as a Stewart platform. A hybrid
          manipulator is a manipulator that combines both serial and parallel
          structures, such as a delta robot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design and analysis of joints of a robotic manipulator involve
          various aspects, such as kinematics, dynamics, control, and
          optimization. Kinematics is the study of the geometry and motion of
          the links and joints without considering the forces and torques
          involved. Dynamics is the study of the forces and torques that cause
          or result from the motion of the links and joints. Control is the
          study of how to regulate the motion and behavior of the links and
          joints using sensors, actuators, and feedback mechanisms. Optimization
          is the study of how to improve the performance and efficiency of the
          links and joints using mathematical methods and algorithms.
