          Robots are machines that can sense, think and act autonomously or
          semi-autonomously. They can perform tasks that are difficult,
          dangerous or tedious for humans, or simply provide entertainment and
          companionship. The history of robots is a fascinating journey from
          ancient myths and legends to modern science and technology.

          The word "robot" comes from the Czech word "robota", meaning "forced
          labor". It was first used in a 1921 play by Karel Capek, called R.U.R.
          (Rossum's Universal Robots), which depicted artificial humanoids that
          rebelled against their creators. However, the concept of artificial
          beings that resemble humans or animals dates back much further.

        </div>
        <p>
          Many ancient cultures had stories of artificial creatures that were
          made by gods, magicians or craftsmen. For example, in Greek mythology,
          Hephaestus, the god of fire and metalworking, created mechanical
          servants and warriors out of gold and bronze. In Chinese folklore, Lu
          Ban, a legendary carpenter and inventor, made wooden birds that could
          fly and mechanical imitations of animals and demons. In Indian
          Buddhism, there are tales of automata that recited sacred texts and
          wept when Buddha died.
        </p>
        <p>
          These stories reflect the human imagination and curiosity about the
          possibility of creating life-like machines. They also raise ethical
          and philosophical questions about the nature and purpose of such
          creations, and their relationship with their creators and other
          beings.

        <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
        <p>
          The history of modern robotics begins with the industrial revolution,
          which ushered in an era of complex mechanics and the use of
          electricity. This, in turn, led to the invention of power machines
          with small compact motors. Some of the earliest examples of such
          machines were automata: self-operating devices that performed
          predetermined actions or movements.

          One of the most famous automata was the Mechanical Turk, a
          chess-playing machine that was built by Wolfgang von Kempelen in 1770.
          It consisted of a wooden cabinet with a chessboard on top, and a
          life-sized figure of a turbaned man holding a pipe. The machine could
          play chess against a human opponent, and even win. However, it was
          later revealed that the machine was actually a hoax: there was a
          hidden human operator inside the cabinet who controlled the movements
          of the figure and the chess pieces.

        <p>
          Another remarkable automaton was the Jacquard loom, invented by Joseph
          Marie Jacquard in 1801. It was a weaving machine that used punched
          cards to control the patterns of the fabric. The punched cards
          represented binary codes that instructed the machine which threads to
          use and how to move them. The Jacquard loom was one of the first
          examples of programmable machines, and influenced later developments
          in computing.

          The 20th century saw rapid advances in science and technology that
          enabled the development of more sophisticated and intelligent robots.
          The term "robotics" was coined by Isaac Asimov, a science fiction
          writer and scientist, in 1941. He also formulated the Three Laws of
          Robotics, which are ethical rules for robots to follow
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
            human being to come to harm.
          </li>
          <li>
            A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such
            orders would conflict with the First Law.
          </li>
          <li>
            A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
            does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Asimov's stories explored the potential benefits and challenges of
          human-robot interaction, as well as the social and moral implications
          of artificial intelligence.

          The ﬁrst patent for what we would now consider a robot was ﬁled in
          1954 by George C. Devol and issued in 1961. They were fixed machines
          that could perform repetitive tasks such as welding, painting or
          assembling parts. The device comprised a mechanical arm with a gripper
          that was mounted on a track and the sequence of motions was encoded as
          magnetic patterns stored on a rotating drum. They were controlled by
          pre-programmed instructions or by remote operators. The ﬁrst robotics
          company, Unimation, was founded by Devol and Joseph Engelberger in
          1956 and their ﬁrst industrial robot was called Unimate, which was
          installed at a General Motors plant in 1961. It was a robotic arm that
          could move metal parts from one place to another.

          The original vision of Devol and Engelberger for robotic automation
          has become a reality and many millions of arm-type robots 5 have been
          built and put to work at tasks such as welding, painting, machine
          loading and unloading, electronic assembly, packaging and palletizing.
          The use of robots has led to increased productivity and improved
          product quality. Today many products we buy have been assembled or
          handled by a robot.

          The first mobile robots were also developed around this time. They
          were autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles that could navigate their
          environment using sensors and algorithms. Some examples are Shakey,
          which was built by Stanford Research Institute in 1966, and Lunokhod
          1, which was sent by the Soviet Union to explore the moon in 1970.

          The first humanoid robots were also created in this period. They were
          robots that resembled humans in appearance and behavior. They could
          walk, talk, gesture and express emotions. Some examples are WABOT-1,
          which was built by Waseda University in Japan in 1973, and ASIMO,
          which was built by Honda in 2000.
